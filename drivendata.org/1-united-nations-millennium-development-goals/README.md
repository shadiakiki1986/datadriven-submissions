Results
-------
Using ML RF didn't get me anywhere in this.

I tried to reshape the data similar to my previous project with http://gsquaredcapital.com/ but it didn't improve the published result on the leaderboard.

The most successful model was simply an auto-regression using only the features that are to be predicted. Using the set `(t-1, t-2, t-3, ...)` resulted in better scores than just `(t-1)`.

I'm not sure how I could have applied ML here.

Feature reduction was unstable because the time dimension is only 36 samples long (36 years).
