# gym-wtp

[openai/gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) environments to simulate

- water treatment plant design, 
- water treatment plant operation, 
- and water treatment plant combined design + operation

The notebooks contain all the implementations.

They also train agents using reinforcement learning to automate the above tasks.

Check the jupyter notebooks in the folder for more info.

The models in the notebooks were implemented in the same order listed above, which is the same as increasing complexity.

The 3rd "combo design + operation" model is still WIP and doesn't work yet as of 2019-02-16
